# Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse
Description: A gesture-controlled virtual mouse that allows users to control their computer's cursor with hand gestures. This project utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to track and recognize hand gestures, enabling precise cursor movement and click functionality.

Features:

Real-time hand tracking using camera/webcam input
Machine learning model for hand gesture recognition, achieving an accuracy of [accuracy percentage]
User-friendly interface to display the virtual mouse cursor and provide visual feedback to the user
Integration with [operating system/platform] to enable seamless interaction with desktop applications

# How it Works

The user places their hand in front of the camera, and the system tracks the hand movements using computer vision techniques.
The machine learning model recognizes and classifies the hand gestures, determining the intended cursor movement or click action.
The system updates the virtual mouse cursor accordingly, providing real-time feedback to the user.
Technical Details:

Programming language: Python
Frameworks and libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch
Computer vision techniques: Object detection, image processing, etc

# Getting Started

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Akasswh/gesture-controlled-virtual-mouse.git
Run the application: python Gesture_controlled.py

# Usage:

Place your hand in front of the camera, with your palm facing downwards.
Move your hand to control the virtual mouse cursor.
Use hand gestures to click, drag, and drop items on the screen.
